All portable Apps are based on [dwarfs](https://github.com/mhx/dwarfs), to compress their runners and use less disc space.

I want to make portable apps with all includet dependencies like: <br />

[Settlers 2 RTTR Portable](https://github.com/Farmer-Markus/s25-RTTR-Portable) <br />
[ATLauncher Portable](https://github.com/Farmer-Markus/ATLauncher-Portable) <br />
